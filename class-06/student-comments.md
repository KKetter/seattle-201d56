# Student Comments from Week 1

### Would you like to describe your past week further?

- It was too uncoordinated and chaotic.  There was no introduction to the curriculum and expectations such as how the grades are weighted, how resubmission works, the expectation of power hour, etc until the end of the week. (we still haven't been told anything about grade weights). 
- I feel like the instruction was more "this thing exists" kind of instruction rather than teaching how it works and how to use it kind of thing, examples of its use, etc.
- Even though I have a background in programming, codefellows' instructors reinforced core topics and taught it at a pace that is welcoming to both experienced and inexperienced students.
- In general, I have lost some attentiveness because it's something that I've done before, though there have been some points of issue in remembering Javascript. I personally consider it a testament to how well the courses were structured a year ago in that I am able to retain all that information.
- The space is a little cramped. There's many seats but sitting all together like that makes me feel like I'm sharing one cubicle with 10 other people. It's a little difficult for my mind to freely work when you're constantly bumping elbows to get in and out of your seat.
- It was great meeting my new cohort and getting better acquainted with the Amazon way but I've experienced the content before so lectures were kind of boring.
- As a previous graduate I see huge strides in improvement in what I really know.  Imposter syndrome is now a thing of the past.
- I'm a little concerned with the order of certain concepts being introduced in the curriculum. As an example, the fact that the class introduced functions and looping through arrays before detailed discussion of data types in Javascript and did not introduce relatively simple array, string, and object methods doesn't make sense to me.

### If you didnâ€™t answer with a 9 or 10, what could we have done differently to earn your referral?

- Even though its a fast paced course, for a beginner like me some background and basic information in the beginning would have been great.
- Teach the basics a bit more before going in full speed. There are some that don't have much experience.
- I think this course is pretty fast paced for a beginner. I'm not sure how they would be able to complete these assignments in a timely manner. Instructions to homework is often vague as well.
- I think the course could be a little more refined in terms of teaching best practices and a clear outlining of fundamentals.

### Which aspects of this course did you find least helpful?

- Learning journals.
- So far - the code review has been useless.  
- Being told to not bother with reading anything out of the books except the "dark pages" and the summary makes the readings feel unimportant.
- When people say something is easy because they have already taken the course. Very discouraging to those who are new at coding.
- So far, I'm not really feeling the daily journal entry. I understand the emotional intelligence is a huge portion of growth and learning capacity. However, I'm not entirely convinced the effectiveness of journal entries atleast for me. I think I'm just better at coding that I am at writing.
- The career assignments were the least helpful, simply because I am employed by Amazon. I saw a lot of value in the career assignments the first time through so I understand their purpose, just not within the context of the current cohort where every student is already employed.
- At one point we were told to only use what we have been taught to date in THIS class, and at another time we were told to just program the best we know how.  This is tough to manage and should be addressed and marked as the standard.
- The career coaching assignments. They don't seem to be tailored to this specific cohort. It's probably difficult with such a wide range of people within one group, but I think they can either be left out or refined more.
- Comments on our classmates reading responses.  Given the short nature of reading giving a "good job" or a few quiz answers does little for my learning. I think having us actually speak about these topics in person would emphasize deepening our learning of current topics but not limit us to just responding to whats in front of us.  We have so many highly qualified students, lets use that more!

### Which aspects of this course did you find most helpful?

- Labs with TAs being available. I don't think I would make it if I didn't have TAs and knowledgeable classmates.
- I think having this many TA's is very helpful. It's easy to get stuck on a problem and it's nice to have help readily available.
- I think the code reviews.
- Seeing the information for the second time and realizing how far I had come.
- Also, Pair Programing was extremely helpful! I haven't had much opportunity to talk/work with other on code, so it forced me to really focus on my communication skills and code logic
- I particularly love all of the focus on growth mindset. Also, I think the structure of having designated lecture and designated lab time every single day, is a really strong cycle to learn and be exposed to new material and practices, and then spend time getting comfortable with them.

### Do you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns?

- The course so far has seemed very disjointed, I understand that the intended instructor has been out sick, so we aren't really following the course plan, but it could be better.  For example, in code reviews we keep looking at people whose code is way more advanced than what a lot of the class is at - which results in us "reviewing" a smattering of concepts that don't have anything to do with what we are learning, leaving many of the class confused.  Then the "instruction" is a lot of explaining about the too-advanced code, leaving little time for explaining what we are supposed to be learning.
- I would say for the next iteration of 201 with Amazon have a series of tracks for moderate and confident JS students would help.
- I realize everything has been crazy with the teacher changes this week, but y'all have been rockstars! I'm very excited to be learning from this team with this kind of curriculum. :) 
- I am concerned about keeping pace with the people who have a lot of experience.
- It seemed like the code reviews were just "fillers". Again, I think code reviews are awesome, but for newbies like us it would be more beneficial for us to have a code along where the instructor can show us industry best practices. As opposed to looking at a coders code which is written completely differently since we weren't shown a "boilerplate" way of coding. And then the instructor just amends that coders code to match their coding style.
- I enjoyed having the mixture of teaching styles for the week. I loved the popsicle stick approach, since it allowed me to learn a few more names for the members of my class. Wish this could be utilized more for the remainder of the team.
